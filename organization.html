  <p class="org">Sometimes you know you want to go somewhere, but don’t yet know exactly where. This is step 1 of how to plan a trip! Browsing for travel destinations  with an open mind can be really fun (and a little addictive)! Here’s how we figure out where to go when we plan travel.
    <br>

We scour pictures on reddit or Pinterest for destinations that look incredible, and then google that location for more information.
<br>
 We shop on AirBnB like we’re browsing for clothes, making wishlists of places to visit. Once we find an amazing AirBnB, we’ll Google the town it’s in. We’ve planned a lot of trips to places we’d never heard of before using this method!
 <br>
We search on Googe Flights, which can show you the cost of flying everywhere in the world from your home town on the dates you specify. We’ve scored some great deals on places we might not have otherwise visited!
Once you’ve figured out where you’re going and booked your trip, the fun part starts!</p>

  <h4 class="title"><strong>2.Determine the dates and time of your trip</strong></h4>
  
  <br><br>
  <img src="image/calendrier.jpg" alt="calendrier" class="shadow"><br><br>
        <p class="org">The ideal is to go abroad for at least 2 weeks to enjoy a maximum. You will have the time to visit the monuments, do some crazy activities and relax in a pool or a beach because traveling is not only about always moving! It's also the right time for each of you to escape from your rushing life or work and be in peace.</p>

  <h4 class="title"><strong>3.Select a budget for each category</strong></h4>
  <br>
  
  <center><img src="image/budget.jpg" alt="budget" class="shadow"></center><br><br>
        <p class="org">Don't forget that you must deal with the different value of the money all around the world. You also have to take in consideration the different level of life in each country. For some countries a certain amount of money will make you rich and for others you will be considered as poor people.</p>
        
         <h5 class="category">For the transport <i class="fas fa-car-side"></i></h5>

           <p class="org">For the transport you have to count on a very large budget which include the airplane and the taxis or local bus for all your move during the trip. With these criteria that you take in consideration. 
           <br>For example when I traveled to Mexico it was approximately 200€ per person for three weeks. </p>
           <br>
           <h5 class="category">For the hotels <i class="fas fa-hotel"></i></h5>
         
             <p class="org">I advise you to not choose only luxury hotels. I think that it's better if you sleep in host home or youth hostel, it will provide you an experience with the local population from the inside. Whereas it's also recommended to keep some time in a pretty hotel with all including to have a time for yourself. 
              <br>For example: During my trip in to Mexico I allowed 15€ per night per person.</p>
              <br>

              <h5 class="category">For the food <i class="fas fa-utensils"></i></h5>
                                 
              <p class="org">In each countries/cities that you will visit, you must try the local specialties. It will bring you new sensations and taste. You will discover an other side of the country/city.
               <br>For example: It cost me 15€ per day and per person to eat for breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner. </p> <ul>
                <br>

                <h5 class="category">For the activities <i class="fas fa-tag"></i></h5>
          
              <p class="org">This category will include almost all the rest of your expenses. It can be culture visit, night out or attraction park.
                <br><br>
          
              <h5 class="category">For the extras <i class="fas fa-money-check-alt"></i></h5>

              <p class="org">Don't forget to keep some budget for the emergency cases like if you hae to see a doctor, go to the hospital, to have your own kit of emergency or to have to pay some extra for the hotels or lunches.</p>

             <p class="org">First, after defining the kind of hotels that you want, you have to compare the prices following the budget that you will allow for each category. You can be helped by different comparating websites as booing, tripadvisor even for the flights that for the hotels and restaurants.</p>

             <br><p class="org">The flights and hotels are extremely booked during the summer season. Therefore it's really important for you to make the reservations as sooner as possible.</p>

         <br>
         <p class="org">It’s important to balance out planning for a trip so that your days don’t feel overly stuffed. I firmly believe that each minute spent wasted in the hotel looking stuff up is a minute I’m not getting to enjoy my trip!
          <br><br>
          But in the same vein, if we map out every single day of a trip down to each tiny detail, we get stressed when our travel plans inevitably fall apart and our entire perfectly planned day – or week, or month – is ruined.
          <br><br>
          As the sort of travelers who are prone to accidents and seem to attract catastrophes and travel fails, we’ve learned that always expect the worst. A well planned trip requires room for failure and flexibility. Here’s what I recommend not worrying about when you plan a trip!
          <br><br>
          <strong>DON’T PLAN AN ITINERARY FOR EVERY SINGLE DAY.</strong>
          Planning each day of your vacation can set you up for disappointment: maybe one day you wake up not feeling up for the activities you have planned, perhaps the weather turns, maybe you find something else you’d like to do instead once you arrive.
          <br><br>
          Sometimes it’s unavoidable, but whenever you can help it, allow yourself room for change.
          <br><br>
          Instead, we recommend planning out a few day options to choose from: perhaps a group of activities all in one area, or a day of seeing museums, etc.
          <br><br>
          Each day, you can choose from your options depending on what you feel like doing that day! Pick the museum day when the weather looks miserable; pick the day that involves the least amount of walking when you’re feeling tired, etc.
          <br>
          <br>
          Also, allow yourself at least a day or two each week that is totally unplanned: that way, you can go back and do whatever you might have missed, explore somewhere new, or just take a day off from exploring to relax!
